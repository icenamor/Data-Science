Question-1 : Give me the artist, song title and song's length in music app history that was heard during sessionId=338, itemInSession=4

Answer 1:

The Question 1 expects Name of the artist, title of the song and length of the track based on sessionId and itemInSession.
As we are working with a NoSQL database, we need to think about the query first which will be used to fetch the data based on which we will create the Table required.

1) The expected output is : "Name of the artist, title of the song and length of the track"
2) Based on : "sessionId and itemInSession"


Question-2:  Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182

The question 2 expects Name of the artist, title of the song and the user sorter by number of the item session. 


Question-3:    Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'

The question 3 expects user name that listen the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
