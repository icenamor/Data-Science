## Introduction
Sparkify is a music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
heir data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. However, this cannot provid an easy way to query the data.

## The goal
The purpose of this project is to create a Postgres database and ETL pipeline to optimize queries to help Sparkify's analytics team.




State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
